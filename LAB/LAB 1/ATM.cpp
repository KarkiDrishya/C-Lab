/*Write a program that takes balance of a userâ€™s account as input. It should then ask the user how
much amount he wants to withdraw from his account. The program should take this amount as
input and deduct from the balance. Similarly it should ask the user how much amount he wants
to deposit in his account. It should take this amount as input and add to the balance. The
program shall display the new balance after amount has been withdrawn and deposited.
Note: Your program should have a check on balance and amount being withdrawn. Amounts
greater than balance cannot be withdrawn i.e. balance cannot be negative.*/
